# Calculating-detonation-parameters-of-propane-oxygen-mixture

Simulation of propane - oxygen mixture detonation with different starting parameters, which are: temperature, pressure
and equivalence ratio. Project purpose is to calculate and analyze detonation parameters.

To run simulation, execute **Code_SDToolbox.py** file.

Environment requirements: 
* Python 2.x
